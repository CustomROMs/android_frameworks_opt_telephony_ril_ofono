# Goal

The goal of this project is to write an Android RIL daemon implemented on top of [oFono](https://01.org/ofono), with a focus on supporting Qualcomm phones. I've forked oFono [here](https://github.com/scintill/android_external_ofono) to add Android-specific support and some raw SMS patches, but I intend to keep it pretty close to the mainline.

# Roadmap

- [x] Alpha implementation
	- [x] Write a RIL class that the com.android.phone app (via the telephony framework) will load. This class will interface with oFono.
	- [x] The oFono instance will be using the `rilmodem` driver. Yes, this first version of the RIL will be built on a RIL! This will hopefully mean fewer "moving parts" and missing functionality to start, allowing us to focus on the basic architecture.
- [x] Pivot oFono onto the `qmimodem` driver
	- [x] Interface for `qmuxd` ([qmiserial2qmuxd](https://github.com/scintill/qmiserial2qmuxd/))
	- [ ] Implement more features (some work will probably be needed in the qmimodem driver), refine things like error-handling, test
	- [ ] Get rid of `qmuxd` and any other proprietary stuff we are relying on
- [ ] Port to another language? (Rust, Go? For now, I'm using Java to lower my learning curve.)

# Usage
1. System patches
	* See `patches` directory. The patches:
		* Change the telephony framework to be able to load the RIL class from a system app package, specified by system property (set in `start` script)
		* Add dbus and ofono services in the init.rc (ofono is disabled until manually started)
		* Add a dbus conf file in /system/etc
		* Update selinux policies for dbus and radio interop
1. Build from CM12.1 checkout with [this manifest](https://github.com/scintill/android/commit/424776d7635ddfae3591516e032cc5820f1dfc1a)
	* `mmm ~/ril_ofono`
	* (Might depend on the rest of android or at least RIL having been built before.)
1. Running
	* Execute the `start` script in the root directory.
	* Getting ofono up can be a bit of an ordeal, on my device at least, due to [apparent timing issues with the rilmodem backend](https://lists.ofono.org/pipermail/ofono/2017-August/017355.html) (my post), so it looks something like this:
		* `adb shell stop`
		* `adb shell start ofonod-debug`
		* `adb shell dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.ofono /ril_0 org.ofono.Modem.SetProperty string:"Online" variant:boolean:"true"`
		* \# look for a bunch of SIM I/O calls in oFono logs. If not, `adb shell killall ofonod` and try the dbus-send again.
		* `./start`
		* `adb shell start`
1. Debugging
    * You can forward the dbus to your PC: `adb forward localfilesystem:/tmp/dbus-android localreserved:dbus`. Then use the dbus address `unix:path=/tmp/dbus-android` for dbus-send, d-feet, etc.
    * Look for log tags `RilOfono`, `OfonoUtils`, and `ofonod` (all in the radio log)

# Features

Nothing is thoroughly tested nor tried on a broad selection of hardware/networks yet, but here's what's been implemented (tested mostly with the rilmodem driver):

* Basic SMS sending and receiving (multipart messages and some international characters tested)
* Basic voicecalls: dialing, receiving, answering, rejecting
	* On my device, oFono seems unable to give Line ID (I think it's a RIL parcel mismatch), so numbers are displayed as "Unknown"
* User-intiated USSD (special dial codes, such as `#999#` which displays balance on my carrier)
* Basic data connections
	* Might be a little flaky; see TODO below
* Reporting of phone #, ICCID, voicemail # to Android

# Resources and Credit
* https://github.com/nitdroid/ofono-ril for some help on mapping ofono properties to Android RIL

# Bugs and TODO
* look at and fix flaky data call setup. It seems the framework doesn't ask us to set up a connection, even if the user toggles the data slider.
	* Toggling airplane mode, or restarting com.android.phone with the slider on, may help as workarounds.
	* Also, turning off wifi may be needed to make sure the framework has a reason to enable mobile data
* make dbus exceptions be checked exceptions, so the compiler will find them and I have to handle them
* dexopt/proguard? - see notes in Android.mk
* crashes in airplane mode trying to query properties on probably not-up interfaces
* remove anonymous auth from dbus.conf (currently there to ease debugging; not needed for the RIL code to connect properly)

# Code review

These should be reviewed more closely for correctness and safety:

* My changes to oFono (logging, SMS PDU patches)
* selinux policy
